Welcome to AlphaRotate's documentation!
===================================

**AlphaRotate** is an open-source Tensorflow benchmark for performing scalable rotation detection on various datasets, which is maintained by Xue Yang with Shanghai Jiao Tong University supervised by Prof. Junchi Yan.

This repository is developed for the following purposes:

* **Providing modules** for developing rotation detection algorithms to facilitate future research.
* **Providing implementation** of state-of-the-art rotation detection methods.
* **Benchmarking** existing rotation detection algorithms under different dataset & experiment settings, for the purpose of fair comparison.
